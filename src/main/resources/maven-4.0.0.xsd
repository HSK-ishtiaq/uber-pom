The following table lists all of the possible child elements.      4.0.0  The location of the parent project, if one exists. Values from the parent project will be the default for this project if they are left unspecified. The location is given as a group ID, artifact ID and version.      4.0.0 Declares to which version of project descriptor this POM conforms.     3.0.0+  A universally unique identifier for a project.

These reports will be run when a user executes <code>mvn site</code>. All of the reports will be included in the navigation bar for browsing.      4.0.0  Default dependency information for projects that inherit from this one. The dependencies in this section are not immediately resolved. Instead, when a POM derived from this one declares a dependency described by a matching groupId and artifactId, the version and other values from this section are used for that dependency if they were not already specified.      4.0.0 Distribution information for a project that enables deployment of the site and artifacts to remote web servers and repositories respectively.     4.0.0  Properties that can be used throughout the POM as a substitution, and are used as filters in resources if enabled.

The dependencies in this section are not immediately resolved. Instead, when a POM derived from this one declares a dependency described by a matching groupId and artifactId, the version and other values from this section are used for that dependency if they were not already specified.      4.0.0 Distribution information for a project that enables deployment of the site and artifacts to remote web servers and repositories respectively.     4.0.0  Properties that can be used throughout the POM as a substitution, and are used as filters in resources if enabled. The format is <code>&lt;name&gt;value&lt;/name&gt;</code>.             4.0.0  The conditions within the build runtime environment which will trigger the automatic inclusion of the build profile.      4.0.0 Flag specifying whether this profile is active by default.     4.0.0  Specifies that this profile will be activated when a matching JDK is detected. For example, <code>1.4</code> only activates on JDKs versioned 1.4, while <code>!1.4</code> matches any JDK that is not version 1.4.      4.0.0  Specifies that this profile will be activated when matching operating system attributes are detected.      4.0.0  Specifies that this profile will be activated when this system property is specified.      4.0.0  Specifies that this profile will be activated based on existence of a file.        4.0.0  This is the file specification used to activate the profile. The missing value will be the location of a file that needs to exist, and if it doesn't the profile will be activated. On the other hand exists will test for the existence of the file and if it is there the profile will be activated.      4.0.0 The name of the file that must be missing to activate the profile.     4.0.0 The name of the file that must exist to activate the profile.       4.0.0  This is the property specification used to activate a profile. If the value field is empty, then the existence of the named property will activate the profile, otherwise it does a case-sensitive match against the property value as well.      4.0.0 The name of the property to be used to activate a profile.     4.0.0 The value of the property required to activate a profile.       4.0.0  This is an activator which will detect an operating system's attributes in order to activate its profile.      4.0.0 The name of the operating system to be used to activate the profile.

In Maven 2, this can also be specified as a range of versions.      4.0.0  The type of dependency. This defaults to <code>jar</code>. While it usually represents the extension on the filename of the dependency, that is not always the case. A type can be mapped to a different extension and a classifier. The type often correspongs to the packaging used, though this is also not always the case. Some examples are <code>jar</code>, <code>war</code>, <code>ejb-client</code> and <code>test-jar</code>. New types can be defined by plugins that set <code>extensions</code> to <code>true</code>, so this is not a complete list.      4.0.0  The classifier of the dependency. This allows distinguishing two artifacts that belong to the same POM but were built differently, and is appended to the filename after the version. For example, <code>jdk14</code> and <code>jdk15</code>.      4.0.0  The scope of the dependency - <code>compile</code>, <code>runtime</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>system</code>, and <code>provided</code>.
